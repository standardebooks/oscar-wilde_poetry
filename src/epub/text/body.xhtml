See nothing save their own unlovely woe,<br/>
Whose minds know nothing, nothing care to know,—<br/>

Delight my discreet soul, else might all kings<br/>
By bloody knout or treacherous cannonades<br/>
Rob nations of their rights inviolate<br/>
And I remain unmoved—and yet, and yet,<br/>
These Christs that die upon the barricades,<br/>
God knows it I am with them, in some things.</p>

Matching our reeds in sportive rivalry,<br/>
While far beneath us frets the troubled purple of the sea.</p>

The wild goat runs across the wold,<br/>

   I know he will come back to me.<br/>
O rising moon!  O Lady moon!<br/>
   Be you my lover’s sentinel,<br/>
   You cannot choose but know him well,<br/>
For he is shod with purple shoon,<br/>
You cannot choose but know my love,<br/>

Stood at his galley’s prow, and let the foam<br/>

And holding wave and wind in boy’s despite<br/>
Peered from his dripping seat across the wet and stormy
night.</p>

Held on his way, and marked the rowers’ time with measured

Up through the soft and silver woods, and when the labouring

Crept to the fane unnoticed by the crowd<br/>

His hot and beating heart upon her chill and icy breast.</p>
<p class="poetry">It was as if Numidian javelins<br/>

And his nerves thrilled like throbbing violins<br/>

Was such sweet anguish that he never drew<br/>
His lips from hers till overhead the lark of warning flew.</p>

Like a young fawn unto an olive wood<br/>
Which in a shady valley by the well-built city stood;</p>
<p class="poetry">And sought a little stream, which well he
knew,<br/>
   For oftentimes with boyish careless shout<br/>
The green and crested grebe he would pursue,<br/>
   Or snare in woven net the silver trout,<br/>
And down amid the startled reeds he lay<br/>
Panting in breathless sweet affright, and waited for the day.</p>
<p class="poetry">On the green bank he lay, and let one hand<br/>
   Dip in the cool dark eddies listlessly,<br/>
And soon the breath of morning came and fanned<br/>
   His hot flushed cheeks, or lifted wantonly<br/>
<a id="page107"/><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>The
tangled curls from off his forehead, while<br/>
He on the running water gazed with strange and secret smile.</p>
<p class="poetry">And soon the shepherd in rough woollen cloak<br/>
   With his long crook undid the wattled cotes,<br/>
And from the stack a thin blue wreath of smoke<br/>
   Curled through the air across the ripening oats,<br/>
And on the hill the yellow house-dog bayed<br/>
As through the crisp and rustling fern the heavy cattle
strayed.</p>
<p class="poetry">And when the light-foot mower went afield<br/>
   Across the meadows laced with threaded dew,<br/>
And the sheep bleated on the misty weald,<br/>

Some woodmen saw him lying by the stream<br/>
And marvelled much that any lad so beautiful could seem,</p>
<p class="poetry">Nor deemed him born of mortals, and one
said,<br/>
   ‘It is young Hylas, that false runaway<br/>
Who with a Naiad now would make his bed<br/>
   Forgetting Herakles,’ but others,

It is Narcissus, his own paramour,<br/>
Those are the fond and crimson lips no woman can
allure.’</p>

They live not long who on the gods immortal come to
spy.’</p>
<p class="poetry">So turned they back, and feared to look
behind,<br/>

Amid the reeds some woodland god reclined,<br/>

And on that day no olive-tree was slain,<br/>
Nor rushes cut, but all deserted was the fair domain,</p>

Raced on the other side, and stopped to hail,<br/>

And gat no answer, and then half afraid<br/>
Passed on his simple way, or down the still and silent glade</p>
<p class="poetry">A little girl ran laughing from the farm,<br/>

And now and then a little tinkling bell<br/>
As the shorn wether led the sheep down to the mossy well.</p>

In sleek and oily coat the water-rat<br/>

Strews the brown mould; or as some shepherd lad in wantonness</p>

Lords of the natural world are yet our own dread enemy.</p>

Loosen the nails—we shall come down I know,<br/>

No need have we of hyssop-laden rod,<br/>
That which is purely human, that is godlike, that is God.</p>

<p class="poetry" style="text-align: center">I.</p>
<p class="poetry">A <span class="smcap">year</span> ago I
breathed the Italian air,—<br/>
And yet, methinks this northern Spring is fair,—<br/>
These fields made golden with the flower of March,<br/>
The throstle singing on the feathered larch,<br/>
The cawing rooks, the wood-doves fluttering by,<br/>
The little clouds that race across the sky;<br/>
And fair the violet’s gentle drooping head,<br/>
The primrose, pale for love uncomforted,<br/>
The rose that burgeons on the climbing briar,<br/>
The crocus-bed, (that seems a moon of fire<br/>
Round-girdled with a purple marriage-ring);<br/>
And all the flowers of our English Spring,<br/>
Fond snowdrops, and the bright-starred daffodil.<br/>
Up starts the lark beside the murmuring mill,<br/>
And breaks the gossamer-threads of early dew;<br/>
And down the river, like a flame of blue,<br/>
Keen as an arrow flies the water-king,<br/>
While the brown linnets in the greenwood sing.<br/>
A year ago!—it seems a little time<br/>
Since last I saw that lordly southern clime,<br/>
<a id="page308"/><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>Where
flower and fruit to purple radiance blow,<br/>
And like bright lamps the fabled apples glow.<br/>
Full Spring it was—and by rich flowering vines,<br/>
Dark olive-groves and noble forest-pines,<br/>
I rode at will; the moist glad air was sweet,<br/>
The white road rang beneath my horse’s feet,<br/>
And musing on Ravenna’s ancient name,<br/>
I watched the day till, marked with wounds of flame,<br/>
The turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned.</p>
<p class="poetry">   O how my heart with boyish
passion burned,<br/>
When far away across the sedge and mere<br/>
I saw that Holy City rising clear,<br/>
Crowned with her crown of towers!—On and on<br/>
I galloped, racing with the setting sun,<br/>
And ere the crimson after-glow was passed,<br/>
I stood within Ravenna’s walls at last!</p>
<p class="poetry" style="text-align: center">II.</p>
<p class="poetry">   How strangely still! no sound
of life or joy<br/>
Startles the air; no laughing shepherd-boy<br/>
Pipes on his reed, nor ever through the day<br/>
Comes the glad sound of children at their play:<br/>
O sad, and sweet, and silent! surely here<br/>
A man might dwell apart from troublous fear,<br/>
Watching the tide of seasons as they flow<br/>
From amorous Spring to Winter’s rain and snow,<br/>
<a id="page309"/><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>And have
no thought of sorrow;—here, indeed,<br/>
Are Lethe’s waters, and that fatal weed<br/>
Which makes a man forget his fatherland.</p>
<p class="poetry">   Ay! amid lotus-meadows dost
thou stand,<br/>
Like Proserpine, with poppy-laden head,<br/>
Guarding the holy ashes of the dead.<br/>
For though thy brood of warrior sons hath ceased,<br/>
Thy noble dead are with thee!—they at least<br/>
Are faithful to thine honour:—guard them well,<br/>
O childless city! for a mighty spell,<br/>
To wake men’s hearts to dreams of things sublime,<br/>
Are the lone tombs where rest the Great of Time.</p>
<p class="poetry" style="text-align: center">III.</p>
<p class="poetry">   Yon lonely pillar, rising on
the plain,<br/>
Marks where the bravest knight of France was slain,—<br/>
The Prince of chivalry, the Lord of war,<br/>
Gaston de Foix: for some untimely star<br/>
Led him against thy city, and he fell,<br/>
As falls some forest-lion fighting well.<br/>
Taken from life while life and love were new,<br/>
He lies beneath God’s seamless veil of blue;<br/>
Tall lance-like reeds wave sadly o’er his head,<br/>
And oleanders bloom to deeper red,<br/>
<a id="page310"/><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>Where
his bright youth flowed crimson on the ground.</p>
<p class="poetry">   Look farther north unto that
broken mound,—<br/>
There, prisoned now within a lordly tomb<br/>
Raised by a daughter’s hand, in lonely gloom,<br/>
Huge-limbed Theodoric, the Gothic king,<br/>
Sleeps after all his weary conquering.<br/>
Time hath not spared his ruin,—wind and rain<br/>
Have broken down his stronghold; and again<br/>
We see that Death is mighty lord of all,<br/>
And king and clown to ashen dust must fall</p>
<p class="poetry">   Mighty indeed <i>their</i>
glory! yet to me<br/>
Barbaric king, or knight of chivalry,<br/>
Or the great queen herself, were poor and vain,<br/>
Beside the grave where Dante rests from pain.<br/>
His gilded shrine lies open to the air;<br/>
And cunning sculptor’s hands have carven there<br/>
The calm white brow, as calm as earliest morn,<br/>
The eyes that flashed with passionate love and scorn,<br/>
The lips that sang of Heaven and of Hell,<br/>
The almond-face which Giotto drew so well,<br/>
The weary face of Dante;—to this day,<br/>
Here in his place of resting, far away<br/>
From Arno’s yellow waters, rushing down<br/>
Through the wide bridges of that fairy town,<br/>
Where the tall tower of Giotto seems to rise<br/>
A marble lily under sapphire skies!</p>

Of meaner lives,—the exile’s galling chain,<br/>
How steep the stairs within kings’ houses are,<br/>
And all the petty miseries which mar<br/>
Man’s nobler nature with the sense of wrong.<br/>
Yet this dull world is grateful for thy song;<br/>
Our nations do thee homage,—even she,<br/>
That cruel queen of vine-clad Tuscany,<br/>
Who bound with crown of thorns thy living brow,<br/>
Hath decked thine empty tomb with laurels now,<br/>
And begs in vain the ashes of her son.</p>
<p class="poetry">   O mightiest exile! all thy
grief is done:<br/>

And Greece stood up to fight for Liberty,<br/>
And called him from Ravenna: never knight<br/>

None fell more bravely on ensanguined field,<br/>
Borne like a Spartan back upon his shield!<br/>
O Hellas!  Hellas! in thine hour of pride,<br/>

O tossing waves of wild Euboean sea!<br/>
O wind-swept heights of lone Thermopylæ!<br/>

Made snow of all the blossoms; at my feet,<br/>
Like silver crowns, the pale narcissi lay,<br/>
And small birds sang on every twining spray.<br/>

Amid the reeds! some startled Dryad-maid<br/>
In girlish flight! or lurking in the glade,<br/>
The soft brown limbs, the wanton treacherous face<br/>
Of woodland god! Queen Dian in the chase,<br/>
White-limbed and terrible, with look of pride,<br/>
And leash of boar-hounds leaping at her side!<br/>
Or Hylas mirrored in the perfect stream.</p>

Hellenic dream!<br/>
Ere long, with melancholy rise and swell,<br/>
The evening chimes, the convent’s vesper bell,<br/>

<a id="page319"/><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>Than
when I woke the silence of thy street<br/>
With clamorous trampling of my horse’s feet,<br/>
And saw the city which now I try to sing,<br/>
After long days of weary travelling.</p>
<p class="poetry" style="text-align: center">VII.</p>
<p class="poetry">   Adieu, Ravenna! but a year
ago,<br/>
I stood and watched the crimson sunset glow<br/>
From the lone chapel on thy marshy plain:<br/>
The sky was as a shield that caught the stain<br/>
Of blood and battle from the dying sun,<br/>
And in the west the circling clouds had spun<br/>
A royal robe, which some great God might wear,<br/>
While into ocean-seas of purple air<br/>
Sank the gold galley of the Lord of Light.</p>
<p class="poetry">   Yet here the gentle stillness
of the night<br/>
Brings back the swelling tide of memory,<br/>
And wakes again my passionate love for thee:<br/>
Now is the Spring of Love, yet soon will come<br/>
On meadow and tree the Summer’s lordly bloom;<br/>
And soon the grass with brighter flowers will blow,<br/>
And send up lilies for some boy to mow.<br/>
Then before long the Summer’s conqueror,<br/>
Rich Autumn-time, the season’s usurer,<br/>
Will lend his hoarded gold to all the trees,<br/>
<a id="page320"/><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>And see
it scattered by the spendthrift breeze;<br/>
And after that the Winter cold and drear.<br/>
So runs the perfect cycle of the year.<br/>
And so from youth to manhood do we go,<br/>
And fall to weary days and locks of snow.<br/>
Love only knows no winter; never dies:<br/>
Nor cares for frowning storms or leaden skies<br/>
And mine for thee shall never pass away,<br/>
Though my weak lips may falter in my lay.</p>
<p class="poetry">   Adieu!  Adieu! yon
silent evening star,<br/>
The night’s ambassador, doth gleam afar,<br/>
And bid the shepherd bring his flocks to fold.<br/>
Perchance before our inland seas of gold<br/>
Are garnered by the reapers into sheaves,<br/>
Perchance before I see the Autumn leaves,<br/>
I may behold thy city; and lay down<br/>
Low at thy feet the poet’s laurel crown.</p>
<p class="poetry">   Adieu!  Adieu! yon
silver lamp, the moon,<br/>
Which turns our midnight into perfect noon,<br/>
Doth surely light thy towers, guarding well<br/>
Where Dante sleeps, where Byron loved to dwell.</p>
